# Change

Hey guys,

Just testing Github as our operating platform. This way we can keep working on Change without having to get out of our ways to get together. Right now we are still on the public repository, which means anybody can join in. I want to upgrade the plan to get the private repository but I want to make sure that we are all on the same page with this. I am willing to put in the work, so if you guys commit to this I will expect effort from you guys too. You are my brothers and it will be awesome to carry on this project together. However, since this is something I truly believe in, I need to know how much time you are willing to spend on this since the beginning, no hard feelings. I do not expect you to spend your entire day on this, I just need an idea of how many hours a week you will be dedicating to it. Let's get a clear understanding of who's in and who's not, and then let's start kicking asses!


P.S. I know this sounds professional AF but if we want to do things well we will need some degree of discipline. ;)

@tyler @connor @george @francesco what do you guys think?


Tyler: Hey so I've figured out the method to creating an open source repo, starting and managing a new branch, making changes or commits in that branch, and opening/merging a pull request. We can get a group call together if you want and I can walk you through. I'll share my notes with you as well.

Guys, or just Matteo lol, this platform is freaking awesome and a very useful tool once you get the hang of it! You just need some practice to get used to it. 

We should thank Matteo for bringing this to the surface for us to see and be a part of. This is the future. This GitHub is great and I wouldn't have known about it for sure so thank you Matteo for showing us.

Sustainability for the World

It's important to understand that reaching a goal for a sustainable world and home is the resposnsibility of every person. This ties in to the whole Cosmopolitan ideology. Now, this term sustainability is sensitive and is often abused in the sense that people will disguise the word and allow it to misrepresent it's true meaning. There are three key factors that must be considered when managing sustainability. These are called the three pillars of sustainability and consist of economic, social, and environmental principals. Please know, whenever implementing a sustainable project and/or ideas, we must think if the project will benefit the effected area economically, socially, and envirnomentally. Until the conclusions are reached that, yes indeed the project benefits all three pillars, then and only then can the project be deemed sustainable.
More to come...Tyler
