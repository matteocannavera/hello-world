# Change

Hey guys,

Just testing Github as our operating platform. This way we can keep working on Change without having to get out of our ways to get together. Right now we are still on the public repository, which means anybody can join in. I want to upgrade the plan to get the private repository but I want to make sure that we are all on the same page with this. I am willing to put in the work, so if you guys commit to this I will expect effort from you guys too. You are my brothers and it will be awesome to carry on this project together. However, since this is something I truly believe in, I need to know how much time you are willing to spend on this since the beginning, no hard feelings. I do not expect you to spend your entire day on this, I just need an idea of how many hours a week you will be dedicating to it. Let's get a clear understanding of who's in and who's not, and then let's start kicking asses!


P.S. I know this sounds professional AF but if we want to do things well we will need some degree of discipline. ;)

@tyler @connor @george @francesco what do you guys think?
